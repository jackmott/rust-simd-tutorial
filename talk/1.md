## What is SIMD?
* **S**ingle **I**nstruction **M**ultiple **D**ata
* Run a single instruction on many values at once.

### Common SIMD Instruction Sets
* Neon (ARM)
* SSE (128 bits)
* **SSE2** 
* SSSE3 
* SSE4.1 
* SSE4.2
* AVX (256 bits!)
* AVX2
* AVX-512 (512 bits!)

## What can it speed up?
 * Physics 
 * Financial calcs
 * Graphics 
 * Parsing / Text Searching (ripgrep)
 * memcpy
 * Anything that isn't too branchy!

 ## Which instruction set to target?
 * SSE2 available on all 64bit intel/amd cpus
 * SSE2 code already generated by rustc by default
 * AVX+ throttles core and/or chip clock rate
 * AVX not any faster on AMD cpus (for now!)
 * SSE2 is a great choice if you pick only one
