# What are intrinsics? Why intrinsics?

## Motivation 1: Inline assembler is hard for compilers
* Supporting inline assembler is hard for compiler writers *(MSVC no longer supports it at all)*
* Inline assembler can cause performance degredation in surrounding code. The compiler is working hard to reason about optimal register use and now you have *ruined everything* (maybe)

## Motivation 2: Inline assembler is hard for humans
* Manage registers by hand!

## Intrinsics
* Look like normal function calls
* Tells the compiler "please emit this machine instruction"
* Programmer doesn't have to worry about registers
* Compiler can reason about registers more easily
* You can still sometimes beat intrinsics by large margins with inline assembler! https://danluu.com/assembly-intrinsics/
* Intel has a handy guide https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/


## Examples
```rust
use std::arch::x86_64::*; //import the intel intrinsics
// #include <x86intrin.h>  <-- C/C++ equivalent
// System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Experimental   <- .Net equivalent


// SSE
let a : __m128 = _mm_set1_ps(2.0);
// a is now [ 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0 ] 
let b = _mm_set_ps(1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0);
// b is now [ 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0 ]   reverse!
let r = _mm_add_ps(a,b);
// r is now [ 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0]

// AVX2
let avx : __m256i = _mm256_set1_epi32(2);
// avx is now [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2];
